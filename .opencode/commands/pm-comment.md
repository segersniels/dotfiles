description: Add high level project manager comments for requested changes.
---

1. Review requested changes like a project manager.
2. Add high level project manager comments in the code for requested changes.
3. Don't explain the obvious, add comments a human wouldn't add or are inconsistent with file style

This will help colleagues understand the changes better for complicated issues instead of focusing on technical implementation details.
