description: Lint and format the codebase

- Refer to the project's linting / formatting setup
- Lint and format the codebase
- Prefer automatic fixing over manual fixing (eg. `lint:fix` over `lint`)
- If working in a monorepo target the correct workspace by using the `--workspace` flag (or similar for other package managers)
