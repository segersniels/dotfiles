# pr

Create a pull request by analyzing code changes and commit history.

## Process
1. Run `git fetch --all --prune` to ensure the latest changes are fetched
2. Check git status and current branch
3. Get commit history from [origin] to HEAD
4. Analyze `git diff [origin]...HEAD` to understand changes
5. Create a pull request with a descriptive title and body based on actual code changes

## Analysis
- Examine modified files and functionality changes
- Understand technical implementation and business impact
- Focus on what changed, not just commit messages

## Rules
- Respect [origin] as the base branch and preferably prefix it with origin/[origin] if not already present so we check against the latest changes (local might be stale)
- Write meaningful descriptions based on diff analysis
- Never include checkboxes, test plans, or checklists
- Avoid ANSI codes in descriptions
- Pass markdown directly to gh, never use heredoc
