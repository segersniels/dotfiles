## Hyper
After running `bootstrap` and `finalize` Hyper should be installed on your machine. You still need to add your Github Gist personal access token to `${HOME}/.hyper_plugins/.hyper-sync-settings.json` and restore settings inside Hyper.

```
Plugins > Sync Settings > Restore Settings
```

After this just restart your Hyper terminal and everything should be ready to go.

## Visual Studio Code
Select `Frontier Rainglow` as theme.
